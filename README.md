Hi! 

I'm a Mathematics student at the University of student, I go by he/him pronouns.

You won't see too much here apart from a lot of random stuff, mainly because I have most of my work on my more private GitHub that I use for uni

I have an interest in writing code for the JVM in either Kotlin or Java, I'm learning Rust and Zig, and I'm quite proficient in C, Python, Haskell and Julia

In my free time I spend a lot of time watching Twitch and playing Minecraft
