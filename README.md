Hi! 

I'm a Mathematics student at the University of Manchester, I go by he/him pronouns.

You won't see too much here apart from a lot of random stuff, mainly because I have most of my work on my more private GitHub that I use for university

I have an interest in writing code for the JVM in either Kotlin or Java, I'm learning Rust and Zig, and I'm quite proficient in C, Python, Haskell and Julia

In my free time I spend a lot of time watching Twitch and playing Minecraft

I'm also trying to create my own Minecraft event at the moment to learn more about the Minecraft ecosystem and more
